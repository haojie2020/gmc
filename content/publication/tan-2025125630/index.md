abstract: ABSTRACT Spin catalysis, which involves the enhancement of electrocatalytic
  reactions by mitigating the constraints on electron angular momentum interactions
  between reactants (e.g., diamagnetic OH‚Åª/H2O) and products (e.g., triplet-state
  O2), holds significant potential to transform the field of oxygen evolution reactions
  (OER). Despite this promise, strategies for controlling spin-polarization and a
  thorough understanding of the underlying spin catalysis mechanism remain considerable
  challenges. Here, we present a coordination engineering strategy to enhance the
  intrinsic OER activity of non-ferromagnetic rutile ruthenium oxide (RuO2) through
  spontaneous spin-polarization. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations
  and experimental characterizations, we demonstrate that moderate interface unsaturation
  in the coordination environment induces a reconfiguration of the electron spin structure
  at the interface, reducing the energy barrier for OER. The optimized RuOx with low
  coordinated configuration (RuOx-L) exhibits enhanced intrinsic catalytic activity,
  with a low overpotential of 217mV at 10mAcm-2 and stable performance over 160hours.
  When integrated into proton exchange membrane water electrolysis, RuOx-L delivers
  1.0Acm-2 at 1.79V, maintaining stable performance for 100hours. This work introduces
  a facial strategy for inducing spontaneous spin-polarization and offers new insights
  into the intrinsic mechanisms of spin electrocatalysis.
