# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: We develop renewable energy-driven catalytic systems to convert water and waste gases (e.g., CO₂) into clean fuels, addressing global warming and energy sustainability. Our innovations achieve industry-leading green molecules conversion activity and selectivity with novel photo/electrocatalysts. By making green fuels cheaper than fossils, we empower a carbon-neutral future.

**Sumary:**

  My work focusing on field‐enhanced photo‐ and electro‐catalysis to drive green hydrogen generation and CO₂-to-chemical conversion, addressing global warming and energy sustainability. By engineering catalysts that respond to magnetic, electric, and strain fields-through electron-spin tuning and ferroelectric-domain design-I leverage operando XAS, Raman spectroscopy, and TEM imaging alongside multiscale simulations to uncover atomic-scale reaction pathways. My work bridges fundamental mechanistic insights with practical reactor engineering, scaling lab-scale electrolyzers into industrial flow cells operating above 1 A/cm² while maintaining high selectivity.
