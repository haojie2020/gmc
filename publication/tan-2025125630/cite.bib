 abstract = {ABSTRACT
Spin catalysis, which involves the enhancement of electrocatalytic reactions by mitigating the constraints on electron angular momentum interactions between reactants (e.g., diamagnetic OH‚Åª/H2O) and products (e.g., triplet-state O2), holds significant potential to transform the field of oxygen evolution reactions (OER). Despite this promise, strategies for controlling spin-polarization and a thorough understanding of the underlying spin catalysis mechanism remain considerable challenges. Here, we present a coordination engineering strategy to enhance the intrinsic OER activity of non-ferromagnetic rutile ruthenium oxide (RuO2) through spontaneous spin-polarization. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental characterizations, we demonstrate that moderate interface unsaturation in the coordination environment induces a reconfiguration of the electron spin structure at the interface, reducing the energy barrier for OER. The optimized RuOx with low coordinated configuration (RuOx-L) exhibits enhanced intrinsic catalytic activity, with a low overpotential of 217mV at 10mAcm-2 and stable performance over 160hours. When integrated into proton exchange membrane water electrolysis, RuOx-L delivers 1.0Acm-2 at 1.79V, maintaining stable performance for 100hours. This work introduces a facial strategy for inducing spontaneous spin-polarization and offers new insights into the intrinsic mechanisms of spin electrocatalysis.},
