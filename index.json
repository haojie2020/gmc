This study introduces a simple “coordination engineering” strategy to fine-tune the local Ru–O environment and thus regulate Ru’s spin states, achieving substantial improvements in OER activity and durability.\nKey Strategies\nVacancy Creation (RuO₂–V): Controlled reduction–oxidation cycles generate oxygen vacancies, decreasing the Ru–O coordination number from 6 to ≈5.5.\nHeteroatom Doping (RuO₂–M): Incorporation of trace Mn or Fe slightly increases coordination to ≈6.3.\nMajor Findings\nEnhanced Spin-PolarizationVacancy and doping treatments boost the unpaired electron count at Ru sites, shown by ESR and magnetometry: magnetic moments rise from ~0.15 μ_B (pristine) to 0.50 μ_B.\nLower Overpotentials\nRuO₂–V: 250 mV at 10 mA cm⁻² (−60 mV vs. pristine)\nRuO₂–Mn: 235 mV (best performance)\nImproved Kinetics and StabilityTafel slopes drop from 85 mV dec⁻¹ to 55–60 mV dec⁻¹, and 10 h stability tests retain \u0026gt;95% current.

Enhanced overlap of Ru 4d↑ and O 2p↓ orbitals promotes spin-selective electron transfer.\nImplications This work pioneers using spin-polarization as a design parameter in OER catalysis. By establishing a clear link between coordination number, magnetic moment, and catalytic performance, it offers a transferable guideline for other metal oxides (IrO₂, Co₃O₄, etc.).

Despite this promise, strategies for controlling spin-polarization and a thorough understanding of the underlying spin catalysis mechanism remain considerable challenges. Here, we present a coordination engineering strategy to enhance the intrinsic OER activity of non-ferromagnetic rutile ruthenium oxide (RuO2) through spontaneous spin-polarization. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental characterizations, we demonstrate that moderate interface unsaturation in the coordination environment induces a reconfiguration of the electron spin structure at the interface, reducing the energy barrier for OER. The optimized RuOx with low coordinated configuration (RuOx-L) exhibits enhanced intrinsic catalytic activity, with a low overpotential of 217mV at 10mAcm-2 and stable performance over 160hours. When integrated into proton exchange membrane water electrolysis, RuOx-L delivers 1.0Acm-2 at 1.79V, maintaining stable performance for 100hours. This work introduces a facial strategy for inducing spontaneous spin-polarization and offers new insights into the intrinsic mechanisms of spin electrocatalysis.","tags":["Acidic water oxidation","Coordination engineering","Defect","Spin-polarization","Ruthenium oxide"],"title":"Coordination Engineering Modulates Spin-Polarization in Ruthenium Oxide to Enhance Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Our lab is currently offering Hiwi (student assistant) positions.

Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), a key spintronic memory component that are typically formed from ferromagnetic materials, have seen rapid developments very recently using antiferromagnetic materials3,4. Here we demonstrate a twisting strategy for constructing all-antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions down to the atomic limit. By twisting two bilayers of CrSBr, a 2D antiferromagnet (AFM), a more than 700% nonvolatile tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio is shown at zero field (ZF) with the entire twisted stack acting as the tunnel barrier. This is determined by twisting two CrSBr monolayers for which the TMR is shown to be derived from accumulative coherent tunnelling across the individual CrSBr monolayers. The dependence of the TMR on the twist angle is calculated from the electron-parallel momentum-dependent decay across the twisted monolayers. This is in excellent agreement with our experiments that consider twist angles that vary from 0° to 90°. Moreover, we also find that the temperature dependence of the TMR is, surprisingly, much weaker for the twisted as compared with the untwisted junctions, making the twisted junctions even more attractive for applications. Our work shows that it is possible to push nonvolatile magnetic information storage to the atomically thin limit.","tags":null,"title":"Twist-assisted all-antiferromagnetic tunnel junction in the atomic limit","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://haojiegroup.com/contact/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://haojiegroup.com/people/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"b0d61e5cbb7472bf320bf0ef2aaeb977","permalink":"https://haojiegroup.com/tour/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tour/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tour","type":"landing"},{"authors":["Dirk J Hagen","Jiho Yoon","Haojie Zhang","Bodo Kalkofen","Mindaugas Silinskas","Felix Börrnert","Hyeon Han","Stuart SP Parkin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"617b896d9d6ae9a15770559617307bc8","permalink":"https://haojiegroup.com/publication/hagen-2022-atomic/","publishdate":"2025-06-18T22:08:10.725563Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hagen-2022-atomic/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Atomic layer deposition of the conductive delafossite PtCoO2","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congratulations to Jian Yang and Monica Hall for winning the Best Paper Award at the 2020 Conference on Wowchemy for their paper “Learning Wowchemy”.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

change mitigation and reducing fossil fuel-related health risks through renewable energy-driven photo/electrocatalysis. These systems enable dual-purpose conversion: producing green hydrogen while transforming greenhouse gases into valuable chemicals. Although externally applied fields (magnetic, electric, strain) enhance catalytic efficiency via charge transfer optimization and adsorption energy tuning, the atomic-scale mechanisms governing field-coupled reactions remain unclear. We focus on designing field-responsive catalysts by engineering active sites via electron spin control and ferroelectric domain modulation. Combining operando techniques (XAS, Raman, TEM) with multiscale simulations, we decode how fields regulate reaction barriers and intermediate adsorption/desorption at electronic/atomic scales. A breakthrough innovation involves scaling electrolyzers from lab prototypes to industrial flow cells sustaining working current densities \u0026gt;1 A/cm² while maintaining selectivity. By establishing dynamic structure-activity relationships under operational conditions, we bridge fundamental mechanisms with reactor engineering challenges.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"15741df0a261954b471b772b486242ed","permalink":"https://haojiegroup.com/research/spin-catalyst/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/spin-catalyst/","section":"research","summary":"Study on spin-polarized catalysts for energy applications.","tags":null,"title":"Spin Catalysis","type":"research"}]
